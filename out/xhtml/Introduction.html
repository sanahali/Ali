            <strong class="ph b">Why an Ice Cream Machine in Shanks Hall?</strong><p class="p">Virginia Techâ€™s English Department is
                proud to present our latest addition to classroom 407, the Cuisinart ICE-60W ice
                cream machine. This product is a gesture to make faculty and students feel more at
                home in Shanks Hall.</p>
<p class="p"></p>
<p class="p">Feel free to use the machine when you have downtime
                studying between classes, to surprise your study group or class with a sweet treat,
                or as a station to hang around and meet other English faculty and students. Consider
                this our upgrade from chatting by the coffee machine! </p>
<p class="p"></p>
<p class="p">The machine was
                generously donated by the English Class of 1998 Alumni committee, who wanted current
                faculty and student to have as sweet of an experience in Shanks Hall as they did.
